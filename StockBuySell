Here is the optimized version of your code with improved readability and better comments to make the logic clearer:

``java
class StockBuySell {

    // Function to calculate the maximum profit
    static int maximumProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int totalProfit = 0; // Variable to store the total profit
        int i = 0;

        // Traverse the array to find buying and selling points
        while (i < n - 1) {
            // Find the local minima (buying point)
            while (i < n - 1 && prices[i] >= prices[i + 1]) {
                i++;
            }
            if (i == n - 1) break; // No more buying points
            int buyPrice = prices[i]; // Set the buying price

            // Find the local maxima (selling point)
            while (i < n - 1 && prices[i] <= prices[i + 1]) {
                i++;
            }
            int sellPrice = prices[i]; // Set the selling price

            // Add the profit from the current transaction
            totalProfit += (sellPrice - buyPrice);
        }

        return totalProfit; // Return the total profit
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example array of stock prices
        int[] prices = {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695};

        // Print the maximum profit that can be achieved
        System.out.println("Maximum Profit: " + maximumProfit(prices));
    }
}
```

### Optimizations and Improvements:
1. **Variable Names**:
   - Changed `lMin` to `buyPrice` and `lMax` to `sellPrice` for better clarity.
   - Changed `res` to `totalProfit` to make its purpose more descriptive.

2. **Comments**:
   - Added clear and concise comments to explain each step of the algorithm.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Added a condition to break the loop if no more buying points are available (`if (i == n - 1) break;`).

4. **Output**:
   - Improved the output message in the `main` method to make it more user-friendly.

### Example Input/Output:

#### Input:
```java
int[] prices = {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695};
```

#### Output:
```
Maximum Profit: 865
```

---

### Explanation of the Output:
- Buy at `100`, sell at `310` → Profit = `310 - 100 = 210`
- Buy at `40`, sell at `695` → Profit = `695 - 40 = 655`
- Total Profit = `210 + 655 = 865`

This optimized version improves readability and ensures the logic is easy to follow.
